          <h2>Clients and Servers</h2>
          <p>Computers connected to the <span>Web</span> are called clients and servers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and <span>Web-accessing software</span> available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
            <li><span>Servers</span> are computers that store <span>webpages, sites,</span> or <span>apps</span>. WHen a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>So What Actually Happens?</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>The browser goes to the <span>DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span>server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
            <li>The browser sends an <span>HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</li>
            <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span>"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
            <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and siplays it to you!</li>
